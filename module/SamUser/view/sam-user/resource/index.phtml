                    <p>PURPOSE, dear brethren, if God shall enable me, to give you a short course of lectures under the general head of "THE SOUL-WINNER." Soulwinning is the chief business of the Christian minister; indeed, it should be the main pursuit of every true believer. We should each say with Simon Peter, "I go a fishing," and with Paul our aim should be, "That I might by all means save some."
                        We shall commence our discourses upon this subject by considering the question</p>

                    <p>The Life in the Spirit Seminars and other renewal programs are life-changing, beginning steps
                        into the full life in the Spirit. But what happens next? Many people follow up on their new experience
                        of the Holy Spirit by participating in a prayer group. But the prayer group is not an end in itself but a
                        means of directing its participants into community life. Christian community is the Biblical context for
                        living the life in the Spirit. The seminars in this book are to lead people from life in the Spirit into
                        community-life in the Spirit.</p>

                    <p>The word "gospel" means "good news." While many well-meaning Christians begin their evangelistic efforts with the good
                        news of God’s love for mankind, that message is lost on unbelievers who must first come to grips with the extent of the
                        bad news. First, man is separated from a holy, righteous God by sin. Second, God hates sin and is “angry with the wicked
                        every day” (Psalm 7:11). Third, death and judgment are inevitable (Hebrews 9:27). Fourth, man is wholly incapable of doing
                        anything about the situation. Until the full extent of this bad news is presented, the good news cannot be effectively communicated.
